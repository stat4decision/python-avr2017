But I would argue it's outside the scope of the site.  &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think the site should be focused on questions which professional data scientists are especially qualified to answer.  Data scientists might be more qualified to &lt;em&gt;pose&lt;/em&gt; ethical questions relating to data (i.e., thinking of ways data could be used that might not occur to others), but I don't feel that this makes them any more qualified to &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; such questions.  Moreover, I think that any such question could be presented in such a way that the potential ethical implications were clear to non-data scientists.  Given this, I think those questions ought to be asked on an ethics-focused site, not a data-science focused one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not just a matter of keeping the focus of this site from getting too broad, but also of getting the best answers to those ethical questions.  With questions of ethics I think it's especially important to get a broader perspective, not limited to those working in a particular field.  Consider how the average government intelligence agent's perspective on the ethics of government surveillance might differ from that of a professional ethicist, or from the broader community, and whether it would really be better for the government agent to only be posing such questions to their peers in the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Also, I think that keeping the site focused on data science theory and practice will keep it more in line with what people would likely expect the site to be about, and more consistent with the level of focus on other sites across the network.  A question like &quot;should physicists accept defense department funding, even if they don't approve of their government's military commitments overseas&quot; would probably be deemed off-topic on physics.stackexchange, and I would expect people to have a similar expectation here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="14" LastActivityDate="2014-05-14T13:34:41.870" CommentCount="2" />

Most of them I didn't, both for others in the community had upvoted the question/answers, and for being not sure whether they were actually off-topic.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/326/python-vs-r-machine-learning&quot;&gt;Python Vs R Machine learning&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/313/books-about-the-science-in-data-science&quot;&gt;Books about the &amp;quot;Science&amp;quot; in Data Science?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/266/what-are-some-easy-to-learn-machine-learning-applications&quot;&gt;What are some easy to learn machine-learning applications?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/253/do-i-need-to-learn-hadoop-to-be-a-data-scientist&quot;&gt;Do I need to learn Hadoop to be a Data Scientist?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/159/is-data-science-just-a-trend-or-is-a-long-term-concept&quot;&gt;Is Data Science just a trend or is a long term concept?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/7/what-open-source-books-or-other-materials-provide-a-relatively-thorough-overvi&quot;&gt;What open-source books (or other materials) provide a relatively thorough overview of data science?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/5/how-can-i-do-simple-machine-learning-without-hard-coding-behavior&quot;&gt;How can I do simple machine learning without hard-coding behavior?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So, my question is, what should be the borderline between on/off-topic recommendation/opinion-based questions?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="84" LastActivityDate="2015-01-30T12:27:11.687" Title="Are recommendation and opinion based questions off-topic?"

Professional organizations have ethical standards and perform ethical inquiries; certification and licensure exams include ethical questions.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, how many people with careers unrelated to the field of data science are obligated to spend time &quot;exercising their data science muscle?&quot; It may be that the best answers to these questions will come from someone who is both an ethicist and a data scientist, but we're probably more likely to find that person here than on a general ethics site.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In fact, there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; no ethics site in the SE network - ethics questions currently belong to philosophy.SE. I don't think it's debatable that the proportion of users who have at least some understanding of both data science &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; ethics and a desire to discuss these questions is much higher here than it will ever be on philosophy.SE. Perhaps at such time as there is a professional ethics site in the network, we could revisit this question, but for now I think it's in our best interest to &lt;strong&gt;treat ethics questions as on-topic, but migrate them to closely related sites like opendata.SE or security.SE on a case-by-case basis&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="322" LastEditorUserId="322" LastEditDate="2014-06-18T19:35:14.720" LastActivityDate="2014-06-18T19:35:14.720" CommentCount="0" />

Tag wikis are designed to hold useful information and aren't held to the same standards as Q&amp;amp;A on either main or meta sites. But there are a few obstacles to that approach:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ol&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;What tag do you put it in? If it's a coherent set of resources, it should be stored in a central location. (In our case this isn't that big a problem since we have an &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/education&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;education&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; tag already in use that could serve this purpose.)&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's generally accepted that very few users ever read tag wikis -- and there's no great way around this except to refer to the resource as frequently as you can justify in the course of other posts and comments.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Users need a lot more reputation to freely edit tag wikis than they would need to edit a community wiki answer.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maintenance and outreach are &lt;em&gt;a ton of work&lt;/em&gt;. This is an obstacle for any approach to collecting a list of resources. You need a core group that's willing to keep links working, add new resources as they become available and update/remove old ones as they change or disappear.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you're really committed to making this work, I would advise you to start building your resource list in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/education&quot; class=&quot;post-tag&quot; title=&quot;show questions tagged &amp;#39;education&amp;#39;&quot; rel=&quot;tag&quot;&gt;education&lt;/a&gt; tag wiki, and use this meta discussion (or a fresh one) as a place to organize your efforts. There is a long tradition of organizing things like retagging and queue-reduction efforts on meta, so such a post would be legitimate, and also give you an idea of whether this community is ready to take on the effort you're suggesting (remember, it's going to also put demands on reviewers to approve the suggested wiki edits) at this point in the public beta.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Time has made a liar of me; today I came across &lt;a href=&quot;http://stackoverflow.com/q/388242/2359271&quot;&gt;this list of C++ reference books on Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great example of how much goes into &lt;em&gt;doing this sort of thing right&lt;/em&gt;. Some important things to note:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Between the question and answer, these wikis have been edited &lt;em&gt;over 100 times by over 50 different users&lt;/em&gt;. Even if we take into account that this is over a period of nearly six years, that's a lot of continuing upkeep for one question.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's tagged FAQ, which suggests that there's an &lt;strong&gt;identified demand&lt;/strong&gt; that this resource satisfies.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It's double-wiki and under &lt;strong&gt;collaborative lock&lt;/strong&gt; to make sure that the greatest number of users are able to pitch in without creating a mess of competing answers.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;It has been contributed to (and heavily reorganized) by community moderators and some of the highest-rep users on SO, all of whom have greatly expanded moderation tools at their disposal.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Despite the continued effort to maintain that particular question, it was created a long time ago. This was a very different site in 2008 and much of what was good practice then is now effectively &lt;em&gt;verboten&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I still think it's a good idea to create this kind of resource in our tag wikis. That being said, it's a massive undertaking for a feature that can &lt;em&gt;support&lt;/em&gt; a healthy site but which is not a &lt;em&gt;substitute&lt;/em&gt; for core content (questions and answers). We have only three non-moderator users who can approve tag wiki edits and our main challenge right now is to grow our community and expand our core content. So in my opinion, it would be best to table any &lt;em&gt;major&lt;/em&gt; effort for now, and revisit this idea when the beta picks up steam.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="322" LastEditorUserId="322" LastEditDate="2014-08-22T17:01:32.207" LastActivityDate="2014-08-22T17:01:32.207" CommentCount="4" />

Personal opinion but it's time to express it. I was very active and excited when it was first lunched but I didn't want to invest time and effort to a site that from early on it was obvious it will end up to the described situation.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first reason is simple: people without enough experience don't get what is different about the (overloaded) term data science compared to programming or statistics. Or between DS.se compared to SO or CV. The difference is not on the topics covered by the questions asked. It is about how the engineering and stats should work together when you need to build a solution to a problem. For example, when I ask the question &quot;How can I measure the mean value?&quot; I expect an answer with a simple formula in CV, or the description of a simple algorithm in SO. In DS I would expect to see an answer on how this can be solved efficiently in a Hadoop cluster, or how it can be estimated in sub-linear time by sampling and so on... I expect answers typically not found or discussed in either CV or SO. Nevertheless, people in here were ready to flag questions off-topic based on the keywords used.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a simplified example, but I hope you get the point. If you don't get the point then this lead us to the second reason... The quality of the questions AND the answers was very low (I stopped checking at all the last few months, I assume  it didn't get much better). This is because questions were asked from software eng. that want to become data scientists. So yes, their questions would get good answers in CV. Also, I have seen few good questions that are answered again by people who don't get the difference between DS/SO/CV leading to naif/low quality answers.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The above are my personal opinion and if you disagree, I am sorry but I don't have the energy or time to change your mind (so don't expect me to answer back). However, I would be really happy to hear what you think is the answer to this question. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="418" LastActivityDate="2014-09-12T10:35:12.417" CommentCount="1" />

We all knew about the overlap from the start and I agree with &lt;a href=&quot;http://meta.datascience.stackexchange.com/a/113/322&quot;&gt;iliasfl's point&lt;/a&gt; that users should be able to expect very different types of answers when asking a question that's on-topic on multiple sites, depending on where they choose to ask. The root of the problem in my view is that too many questions like these are being treated as appropriate/acceptable content:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/1151/322&quot;&gt;Prerequisites for Data Science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/41/322&quot;&gt;Is the R language suitable for Big Data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/778/322&quot;&gt;Is Python suitable for big data&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/253/322&quot;&gt;Do I need to learn Hadoop to be a Data Scientist?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/334/322&quot;&gt;What do you think of Data Science certifications?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://datascience.stackexchange.com/q/793/322&quot;&gt;Uses of NoSQL database in data science&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I'm not saying every one of these questions should clearly be closed or that any of them necessarily deserve downvotes, but &lt;em&gt;questions like these&lt;/em&gt; at some point came to represent a major portion of the site's content. I used to come read through the new questions here every day (when I had more free time) and I definitely started to feel like the noise was overwhelming the signal. That's &lt;em&gt;really bad&lt;/em&gt; for a site that has yet to establish itself; it's a strong disincentive for attracting and retaining expert users at a time when building a strong user base is most critical.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It's not the &lt;em&gt;naiveté&lt;/em&gt;  of these questions that makes them bad content – beginners are perfectly capable of asking thought-provoking, well-researched, non-trivial questions. For that matter, even a &lt;em&gt;trivial&lt;/em&gt; question can make for good content, provided it's well-defined and difficult to answer through secondary research (or the answer is simply not available online).&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The main problem with these questions is that they don't fit the format of the network, which isn't something to be taken lightly. The Q&amp;amp;A format of Stack Exchange is a purposeful and central part of its design that has evolved over the years to better support that &quot;repository of useful and accurate answers&quot; mission. We discourage questions like the above – primarily by closing them – because &lt;em&gt;they hurt that mission&lt;/em&gt;. To quote from Jeff's blog entry, &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2011/06/optimizing-for-pearls-not-sand/&quot;&gt;Optimizing For Pearls, Not Sand&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;It’s true that you can’t have Q&amp;amp;A without &lt;em&gt;questions&lt;/em&gt;, but having the&#xA;  wrong sorts of questions is far more dangerous. The fastest way to&#xA;  kill any Q&amp;amp;A site is to flood it with low-quality questions....&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now, in our case it's not that we're being flooded with terrible, awful, no-good, very bad questions. These aren't questions nobody should ever ask, anywhere; they're questions that are of &lt;em&gt;practically no interest&lt;/em&gt; to the community of experts that we need to attract in order to generate &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; high-quality content that in turn attracts &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; questions and &lt;strong&gt;builds and retains momentum for a young site&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the major flaw with the position that some have held throughout this beta that since we lack content, we should be less choosy about what content is acceptable. Actually, I think the opposite is true in a beta – the less content we have, the less signal we have, and the more important it is to weed out the noise. It's only by being choosy and scoping the site &lt;em&gt;with the ultimate goals in mind&lt;/em&gt; that we send the message to the expert community: &lt;em&gt;Stick around because this place is growing into something worthwhile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is closely related to the conclusion of the aforementioned blog post:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;Answers are the real unit of work in any Q&amp;amp;A system. Therefore, the&#xA;  only logical thing to do is to &lt;strong&gt;maximize the happiness and enjoyment of&#xA;  answerers&lt;/strong&gt;. If this means aggressively downvoting or closing unworthy&#xA;  and uninteresting questions, so be it. Without a community of people&#xA;  willing to &lt;em&gt;answer&lt;/em&gt; questions, it really doesn’t matter if there are&#xA;  questions at all, does it?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As to whether the site is &quot;dying&quot;... I think it would be a mistake to think that any beta is &lt;em&gt;easy&lt;/em&gt;, if only we have the right policies or cast the right votes. But it may be that DataScience.SE is a particularly hard site to build, at least at the present time. The field itself is very interdisciplinary and very young; how many people really think of themselves as data science experts? Or think of their problems specifically as data science problems? I very much believe this site can and should exist, but the evidence seems to indicate that it's not practical in this incarnation at this time.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="322" LastActivityDate="2014-09-26T20:46:29.800" CommentCount="0" />

If a question is in its &lt;strong&gt;essence&lt;/strong&gt; more about data science (models, approaches, methods, tools, etc.), where a programming language represents just a &lt;em&gt;context&lt;/em&gt;, then such question fits &lt;em&gt;Data Science SE&lt;/em&gt; site better. If, alternatively, the situation is reversed, where programming (coding) aspects are the core of the question, while data science represents context, such question should be asked on (or migrated to) &lt;em&gt;StackOverflow&lt;/em&gt; (with a corresponding tag, i.e. &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;python&lt;/code&gt;).
